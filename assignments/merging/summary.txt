Git merge is a powerful feature that allows developers to combine multiple branches of code into a single branch. This is particularly useful when working on a project with multiple developers, as it allows each developer to work on their own branch of code and then merge their changes back into the main branch. Git merge works by comparing the changes made in each branch and then combining them into a single branch. This process can be automated using Git merge tools, which can help to reduce the risk of conflicts and errors.
