Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. Git branching is a feature that allows developers to create multiple versions of the same codebase, called branches, which can be worked on independently of each other. This is useful for developing new features, fixing bugs, and experimenting with new ideas without affecting the main codebase.
